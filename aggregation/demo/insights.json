        "description": "The detection coverage is heavily concentrated on tactics such as Credential Access, Persistence, and Defense Evasion, with significant rule mappings for techniques like Valid Accounts (T1078) and Modify Authentication Process (T1556). However, there are notable gaps in tactics such as Lateral Movement and Collection, which have fewer rule mappings despite their critical role in an attack lifecycle. Addressing these gaps could enhance the organization's ability to detect and respond to threats effectively.",
        "insights": [
          "Lateral Movement techniques like Remote Services (T1021) and Use Alternate Authentication Material (T1550) have relatively low rule mappings. Increasing coverage here can improve detection of adversaries moving within the network.",

However, there is relatively sparse coverage in the 'Reconnaissance' phase, which could be an area for improvement to catch threats earlier in the attack lifecycle.",

          "Consider adding more detection rules for the 'Command and Control' phase, specifically targeting techniques such as 'Proxy (T1090)' and 'Protocol Tunneling (T1572)', to better identify and respond to adversaries' attempts to maintain access and control over compromised systems.",
          "Increasing detection coverage for the 'Actions on Objectives' phase, focusing on techniques like 'Data Destruction (T1485)' and 'Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486)', can enhance the ability to detect and mitigate potential data loss or encryption attacks."
